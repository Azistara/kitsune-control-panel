# Kitsune Control Panel

The Kitsune Control Panel provides realtime status and information about the currently running server.
It is primarily developed using React and Node.js.

# Stack
- React: User Interface frontend.
- react-bootstrap: UI/UX framework for building easy web interfaces.
- Node.js: Server communications backend.
- systeminformation: Provides detailed information about various components on the server.
- Axios: Provides API access between client and server.
- Recharts: Provides visual data about CPU, RAM, Disk, and Network usage.

# Motivation
I host a server at home using a PC I built from scratch. Prior to this project, the only way to interface with the server itself
was through SSH and it proved tedious as to remembering varous commands to do the most basic thing. Why could I have just gone with
other, well known control panel interfaces such as Webmin? I wanted to take a jab on developing a full-stack project on my own.
